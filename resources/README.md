This is where you will find copies of documents presented or referenced during the various meetings we will be having.  In each directory, you will find an Agenda and the content for that session.


Below are some collections of resources that we have talked about throughout the workshops:

## Curricula
 - [Exploring Computer Science](http://www.exploringcs.org/)
 - [AP CSP](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-principles?course=ap-computer-science-principles)
    - [Wikipedia table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP_Computer_Science_Principles)
 - [AP Computer Science A](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a?course=ap-computer-science-a)
 - [Curricula Comparison Document from Massachusetts](http://www.edc.org/massachusetts-k-12-computer-science-curriculum-guide) - [PDF](http://www.edc.org/sites/default/files/uploads/CurriculumGuide-web.pdf)

## Programming Resources
### Block based languages and resources
 - [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) - classic block-based programming language.  Runs in the browser.
 - [Snap!](http://snap.berkeley.edu/) - a reimplementation of Scratch with some more advanced language features (functions and lists).  Scratch has since added some of these features to the language.  Runs in the browser.
 - [App Inventor](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/) - another block based language that can also be executed on an Android device.  An emulator is also available if you don't have or want to use an Android device.  Emulator does need to be downloaded.
 - [Alice](https://www.alice.org/) - An object oriented block-based language.  Can also access the Java underneath the block-based implementation.  Requires a download.
 
### Text-based languages and resources 
 - [Python](https://www.python.org/) - Python 2.7 is more widely supported on systems, but Python 3.x is newer.  Python 3.x is not backward compatible.  There are several web/cloud based development environments for Python, including the following.
 - Javascript - another popular text-based language used in the curricula mentioned above.  (need a link)
 - [Repl.it](https://repl.it/)
 - [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/)
 
 Many of these languages (block- and text-based) have libraries to drive various robots designed for education.

## Unplugged and Plugged Lessons
 - [Code.org](https://studio.code.org/courses?view=teacher) (several curricula, tools, lessons, videos)
    - Code.org has their own block-based language that is similar to the others.  They also use Javascript for text-based programming.
 - [Beauty and Joy of Computing](http://bjc.berkeley.edu/) (an implementation of AP CSP)
    - Uses Snap! as the basis for programming.
 - [CS Unplugged](http://csunplugged.org/)
    - Activities that do not require a computer.  Aimed at a younger group, but can easily be adapted/extended for an older audience.
    
# Diversity Resources
 - [Cracking the Gender Code](https://girlswhocode.com/crack-the-code/) - report by Girls Who Code and Accenture on how to get girls involved in computing.  Hint: there is a HS gap that this group could help address.
 - [NCWIT](https://www.ncwit.org/) - National Center for Women in Information Technology - many great resources on a variety of topics.  Also some funding for student groups and initiatives.
 - [Aspirations Awards](https://www.aspirations.org/) - awards for high school girls who are interested in computing to get a scholarship and some other really cool opportunities through NCWIT.
 - [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/) - a program to help get girls to learn computing.  Targetting middle school and high school girls.  Possibly a program to recommend some students to pursue.  The public library in La Crosse has started an initiative and I know a former student who led one of the summer workshops in 2017.
