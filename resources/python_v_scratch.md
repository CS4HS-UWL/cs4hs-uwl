Introduction
=============

We will compare the development of two programs in two different languages.

In this discussion we will talk about:
 - modifying existing code (extending functionality)
 - debugging existing code (changing current functionality)
 - testing code
 - comments
 - cognitive load of each language
 - limitations and tradeoffs
 

Scratch
=======

The following studio contains three versions of the number guessing game.  The versions show different stages of development of the program.

Python
=======

The following programming sessions demonstrate the same programs in Python at the same points in development.

First version of number guessing game for python:

Second version:
https://repl.it/ElCG/5

Final:
https://repl.it/ElEM/2


Parsing 1:
https://repl.it/ElGX/5

Parsing 2:
https://repl.it/ElGs/3

CSV example in python3 - demonstrates the ability to deal with files and thus large amounts of data.
