# Code.org Tools for Data Representation and the Internet
=======================================================

This document describes and links to several of the tools that are provided by [Code.org](https://code.org/) 
and a summary of what they provide.

* [Code.org](https://code.org/) - contains lots of information for students and instructors. 
There are learning tools for students of different ages and interests.  They have their own 
development environment, but they also link to other tools too.

* Click on **TEACH** along the top bar. (https://code.org/educate)
From here you can view materials and resources for different age groups, programs, and more.  Today we are going to check out their tools and videos.

* Click on **Tools and Videos** at the bottom of the page. (https://code.org/educate/resources/videos)
They have GREAT videos and add more periodically!!  We will talk about the internet videos today.  Note that the videos launch as a kind of pop-up, not in a separate tab or window.  If you want to get a link for sharing with your students or putting on a website like this, then launch the video, pause it, and click the YouTube button at the bottom.
Also, the captions are correct which is nice for hearing impaired students or lack of sound.

    - What is the Internet? (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dxcc6ycZ73M)
    This is a great introduction video.  There are some funny misconceptions about the internet that are debunked.  Not a lot of content, but it would be good to show before you start talking about the internet with your students.
    
    - There are 6 more videos that go indepth about different aspects and layers of the internet.  These again can serve as a nice introduction to a topic before discussing the ideas and doing an activity.  These videos are more serious than the first one, in that they focus on the actual concepts and technologies, rather than silly things people believe about the internet.
    
    - The Internet: Wires, Cables & WiFi (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhEf7e4kopM)
    This video discusses the physical layer of the network stack.  The ideas of binary, information encoding, sending and receiving, bandwidth, and latency are introduced. Copper, fiber, and wireless transmission mediums are presented and compared.
    
    - The Internet: IP Addresses and DNS (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o8CwafCxnU&t=39s)
    This video discusses the architecture and design of the internet, and how addresses are used to implement it.  IPv4, IPv6, and DNS are briefly discussed.  Ideas of hierarchies and distributing information are presented, along with possible attacks (DNS spoofing).
    
    - The Internet: Packets, Routing, & Reliability (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o8CwafCxnU&t=39s)
    This video discusses how large amounts of data are broken up, sent across the internet, and how they travel reliably.  Introduces ideas of data and headers, fault tolerance, and routing.
    
    - The Internet: Encryption and Public Keys (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZghMPWGXexs)
    This video discusses how data can be encrypted before sent across the internet.  Several encryption algorithms are presented.  There are some tools for playing with some of these encryption algorithms.  Another encryption video I like is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEBfamv-_do.
    
    - The Internet: Cybersecurity and Crime (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuYNXgO_f3Y)
    This video is an overview of cybersecurity attacks including: viruses, malware, DDOS, and phishing.  Also mentions cyberwarfare and how states are developing offensive and defensive cyber teams.
    
    - Basic and Inspirational videos.  These can be great for programming segments, attracting students to your classes, or for sharing in other contexts.  I have used the inspirational videos in programming workshops for middle school students.
    
* In addition to videos, there are tools that can be used to explore these concepts, and currciulum materials to go with them!  The internet material we will be looking at today has been designed for AP CS Principles, but the tools and lessons could be adapted for different uses as needed.  

* Continue scrolling to the bottom of the page to get to **Build on problem solving skills with these digital tools** (https://code.org/educate/csp/widgets).  This page describes some widgets for exploring concepts, and the AP CSP lesson plans that have been created.  We are looking at the internet lessons, which has a large amount of material associated with it.

* Internet Simulator - Code.org has created curriculum materials for the entire unit on the internet which is supported by several videos, lesson plans, and the internet simulator.  Before looking at the tool, it is important to see how they have structured the unit so that you know what context each lesson has.

    - Overview: https://curriculum.code.org/csp/unit1/
    This describes the 5 week unit and the 14 lessons associated with it.  The first two weeks are dedicated to encoding data and interpretting it.  The internet simulator is used to show how data is sent across the wire in binary to another party.  The last three weeks focus on internet technologies and concepts of addressing, routing, redundancy, and more.  We will take a look at a few pieces of some of the lessons to see how they are structured and how the tools work.
    
    - Lesson 7: Encoding and Sending Formatted Text https://curriculum.code.org/csp/unit1/7/
    We know that data is sent across the wire as binary bits.  We also know there is a specific way we can encode characters called ASCII.  In this lesson, we will work in pairs to invent a text formatting language that allows us to not only send text information but make it look pretty.  The challenge is that the simulator can only send ASCII characters, so the text formatting language can only use those values to represent the formatting and the data.
    
        - Link to tool so you can send messages to your partner: http://studio.code.org/sections/CZYMXP
            
            + Login using the random words I gave you.
            
            + Scroll down to Stage 7, and select Internet Simulator
            
            + before working on the protocol, it is useful to just get used to how the tool works.  Send some messages to each other in plain text.  Be sure to look at how the data is encoded and the settings on your device to control packet size and bit rate.
            
            + now that you know how messages are sent, discuss with your partner the protocol for text markup and send some test messages.  Make sure your partner can correctly interpret your markup.
        
        - How to create your own class so your students can do this activity
        
            + login as a teacher
            
            + teacher dashboard: https://code.org/teacher-dashboard#/
            
            + student accounts and progress > https://code.org/teacher-dashboard#/sections
            
            + create the section
            
            + manage students to create accounts
            
            + you can use email addresses to create accounts or random words.  I used random words today to not conflict with actual accounts.  They can create a password list handout for easy account management!  :)
            
            + check out progress for your class.  My CT100 class from last semester: https://code.org/teacher-dashboard#/sections/810726/progress
