# Code.org Tools for Data Representation and the Internet
=======================================================

This document describes and links to several of the tools that are provided by [Code.org](https://code.org/) 
and a summary of what they provide.

* [Code.org](https://code.org/) - contains lots of information for students and instructors. 
There are learning tools for students of different ages and interests.  They have their own 
development environment, but they also link to other tools too.

* Click on **TEACH** along the top bar. (https://code.org/educate)
From here you can view materials and resources for different age groups, programs, and more.  Today we are going to check out their tools and videos.

* Click on **Tools and Videos** at the bottom of the page. (https://code.org/educate/resources/videos)
They have GREAT videos and add more periodically!!  We will talk about the internet videos today.  Note that the videos launch as a kind of pop-up, not in a separate tab or window.  If you want to get a link for sharing with your students or putting on a website like this, then launch the video, pause it, and click the YouTube button at the bottom.
Also, the captions are correct which is nice for hearing impaired students or lack of sound.

    - What is the Internet? (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dxcc6ycZ73M)
    This is a great introduction video.  There are some funny misconceptions about the internet that are debunked.  Not a lot of content, but it would be good to show before you start talking about the internet with your students.
